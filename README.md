# **SQL Data Exploration – COVID-19 Analysis**
## **Overview**
This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data from 2020 to the end of 2021 using SQL. The dataset includes information such as confirmed cases, deaths, population, and locations across different countries. The goal is to extract insights by writing SQL queries and visualizing the results in Tableau.
## Dataset
The dataset contains global COVID-19 statistics, including:

- Date-wise records of confirmed cases and deaths

- Country-wise population and case distribution

- Aggregated data for different time periods
## Objectives
Using SQL queries, I aim to answer specific questions such as:
- What are the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths?
- What is the death rate for different countries?
- How do COVID-19 cases trend over time?
- Which regions were most affected during peak periods?
## Tools & Technologies
- SQL: Used to write queries and extract insights from the dataset.
- Tableau: Used to create visualizations based on the query results.
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Import the SQL file into your preferred database management system.
3. Run the queries to analyze the dataset.
4. View the Tableau visualizations to interpret the data more effectively.
## Files
- covid_analysis.sql – Contains SQL queries used for data exploration.
- tableau_visuals/ – Folder containing Tableau visualizations (if included).
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used for data analysis and how data visualization enhances understanding. It provides insights into COVID-19 trends and their impact on different countries.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project for learning purposes!
